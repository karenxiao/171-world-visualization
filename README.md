###How do you run our code? 
Our project can be viewed by clicking our html file within this directory and run locally. The 	entire project is contained within the file, and will be run if all the documents we sent remain within the same directory. 

###Which parts of our code are responsible for what? 
* d3.js contains our d3 library that we have utilized to create the dynamic visualizations in our project. 
* data.js formats the data properly in order to create usable output for DataMaps
* datamaps.js contains the datamaps add-on that we use to create the map in our project
* graph.js creates our line graph using D3, creating two lines that allows the user to compare country trends over time 
* index.html houses the HTML for our project, and is what is visible when the user visits our site
* map.js implements an interactive map using the DataMaps add-on
* style.css contains all the style for our project and is linked to our page
* intro.js and introjs.css controls the intro "tutorial" to our project

###Which parts are libraries and are they hosted in the folder or externally online? 
Both of the libraries are hosted in the folder (in separate javascript files), and the two libraries we used are the d3 library and the DataMaps add-on library. We used the intro.js library as well, hosted in our javascript folder.

###What data files are we using and how are they being fed into the code? 
We are using data collected from the OECD website, and it is directly hosted in our HTML file as JSON.
